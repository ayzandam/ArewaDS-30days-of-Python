# Declare a variable is_light_on and assign a value to it
is_light_on = False

# Declare multiple variable on one line

# Exercise 2

# Check the data type of all your variables using type() built-in function

# Checking data type

# Declare 5 as num_one and 4 as num_two

remainder = num_one % num_two

# Calculate num_one to the power of num_two and assign the value to a variable exp
exp = num_one ** num_two

# Find floor division of num_one by num_two and assign the value to a variable floor_division

# Take radius as user input and calculate the area.
rad = int(input("Enter radius of a circle: "))

# Use the built-in input function to get first name, last name, country 
# and age from a user and store the value to their corresponding variable names
